Problem 1 in PS3; Tianyi Zhang

The article I chose to read was "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" by Greg Wilson. 
I have a question about automating repetitive tasks in scientific computing. Generally, writing functions in R will automate repetitive tasks. However, in some cases, some tasks are similar in parts instead of purely repeating. In this scenario, do we make all efforts to spend more time writing a function as general (have quiet more inputs) as possible so that it would be suitable for all similar tasks? Another choice is to write similar functions to similar tasks which will decrease the reproducibility, but spend little time on single project. Moreover, the latter approach also corresponds to the advice that optimizing codes after it works correctly.

My second approach is related to the version control software Git. I found that it was a disaster to use Git and Dropbox (or other sync tools) simutaneously, if I had two computers working on the same project. The dropbox will sync first and then I use git pull there would be a conflict message.
