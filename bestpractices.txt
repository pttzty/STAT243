Problem 1 in PS3; Tianyi Zhang
The article I chose to read was "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" by Greg Wilson. 
I have a question about automating repetitive tasks in scientific computing. Generally, writing
functions in R will automate repetitive tasks. However, in some cases, some tasks are similar in
parts instead of purely repeating. In this senario, do we make all efforts to spend more time writing
a function as general (have quiet more inputs) as possible so that it would be suitable for all simialr
tasks? Another choice is to write similar functions to similar tasks which will decrease the reproducibility, 
but spend little time on single project. Moreover, the latter approach also corresponds to the advice that 
optimizing codes after it works correctly.
